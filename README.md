# cuMap

Indoor Navigation System for Android

## Getting Started

This application uses a database for initial Map of or university campus. For detecting current position of the user, we use Wi-Fi signals to get 3 distance and their initial positions. After we get 3 distance from Access Points, a triangulation algorithm will run and find current position of the user.  
This application uses Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm for calculating shortest path between initial and final position.
