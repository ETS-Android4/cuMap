Indoor Navigation System for Android

## Getting Started

This application uses a database for initial Map of or university campus. 
For detecting current position of the user, we use Wi-Fi signals to get 3 distance for initial position. After we get 3 distance from Access Points, a triangulation algorithm will run and find current position of the user.
